# Multi-Factor Authentication

## Project Description

This project implements an on-chain Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system using Move smart contracts on the Aptos blockchain. The system enables users to secure their digital identities by requiring multiple verification methods before granting access to protected resources. Users can configure various authentication factors such as biometric verification, SMS codes, email verification, hardware tokens, and other security methods to create a robust, decentralized authentication framework.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize digital security by bringing Multi-Factor Authentication directly onto the blockchain, creating a trustless, transparent, and immutable authentication system. By leveraging the inherent security and decentralization of blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate single points of failure in traditional authentication systems while providing users with complete control over their security configurations. This on-chain MFA system will serve as a foundation for secure decentralized applications, protecting user assets and sensitive operations in the Web3 ecosystem.
